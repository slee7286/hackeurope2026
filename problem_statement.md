## Aphasia

> Aphasia (pronounced Uh-FAY-zhuh) is a communication disorder caused by a stroke, brain injury, or, more rarely, a condition called Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). It affects a person’s ability to use language.  Therefore, a person may have challenges talking, understanding others, reading, writing, and using numbers.

## Problem statement

Research has shown that those suffering from aphasia find understanding unfamiliar accents significantly more difficult. Despite this, existing digital therapy solutions do not allow patients to learn from accents they encounter in their daily lives. Current technological aids in speech and language therapy to treat aphasia do not provide intelligent, adaptable and customisable experiences to patients.

## Solution

Using agentic AI and natural sounding AI voices we will develop a modern speech and therapy solution.
