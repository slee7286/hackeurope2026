## Aphasia

> Aphasia (pronounced Uh-FAY-zhuh) is a communication disorder caused by a stroke, brain injury, or, more rarely, a condition called Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). It affects a person’s ability to use language.  Therefore, a person may have challenges talking, understanding others, reading, writing, and using numbers.

## Problem statement

Research has shown that those suffering from aphasia find understanding unfamiliar accents significantly more difficult. Despite this, existing computer based therapies do not allow patients to learn from accents they encounter in their daily lives. Current aids in speech and language therapy to treat aphasia do not provide intelligent, adaptable or customisable experiences to patients.

>The results indicate that non-native accented speech affects comprehension even on simple tasks in ideal listening conditions. The findings suggest that speaker accent, especially accents varying in both segmental and prosodic features, can be a barrier to successful interactions between non-native accented speakers and native listeners, particularly those with aphasia.

>The impact of speaker accent should be considered in the rehabilitation of individuals with aphasia following stroke. Clinical implications include the possibility of underestimating an individual's language abilities on assessment, and the potential errors in comprehension that may occur.

## Solution

Use agentic AI to develop custom speech and language therapy sessions based on up to date information on topics that are actually relevant to the patient's life. Deliver sessions in the patient's regional accent using natural sounding AI voices from Elevenlabs' extensive voice library or clone the voice of a friend or family member. Sessions adapt to the patient's level, even tuning the speed of speech.x
